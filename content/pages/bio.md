I like to design and code simple, usable products.

I am an designer turned engineer now helping deliver medications at [Echo](https://www.echo.co.uk/) by building warehouse tools and other weird things.

Previously I worked [Deliveroo's UI Infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C0yvuWJc84) team and headed up design at [Lyst](https://lyst.com).
