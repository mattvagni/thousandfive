I like to design and code simple, usable products and design systems.

Currently I work as a designer at [Deliveroo's](https://deliveroo.co.uk) UI Infrastructure team. I work on our internal design systems and tooling to help designers and engineers collaborate more easily and be more productive.

Previously I headed up design at Lyst for almost 5 years, growing the company from 5 to 120 people.

I also recently started [a slack group](https:) for product designers in London to talk shop.
